This application was developed for the **Coursera Data Science Capstone Final Project**. 
The goal of the project is to create a product to highlight a next word prediction algorithm 
and to provide a convinient user interface.

### Application Open / User Interface
1. When the application is initially opened, the User Entry box will be blank and the Next Word Prediction box will display **"NULL"** 
2. The user then enters part of a sentence in the User Interface section, the next word prediction logic will be activated

### Actions / Results
1. After the user starts to enter a sentence, the next word the application's algorithm predicted will be displayed in the Next Word Prediction textbox.
2. The user's entry will be displayed in the Next Word Prediction section
